	hi journal, today in class i started to create my cake project. in this project i want to be able to customized a cake to my liking. i picked out a couple common toppings for a cake and started to learn how to create this project.

	<p> dec. 12 <br>
	hi journal, today in class i finished my cake maker. now you can make a cake with as many or as little topping as you want. one challenge in this project was understanding the code that allowed me to add the toppings to the cake.  </p>
