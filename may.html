	hi journal, this is my last journal of the year! during my time in comp sci 1 i have learned a lot; i have learned to problem solve, how to use different code, and learned that i really like computer science. my final project was about my horseback riding progress. overall, i am very proud of my progress in this class and the things i have created!
